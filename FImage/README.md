# FImage, to play with colors

It is a software under development which has defects and, most certainly, bugs. It is even incomplete on some points. It is therefore ***strongly*** advised to save the images you want to process with this application.

The purpose of this application is to be able to modify images in terms of colors, hues, saturations and some other parameters of the same type. The filters currently offered are rough and cannot be customized. But this will change.

## quick start

- Make sure you have an up-to-date ***Windows 10***,
- Download the [ZIP file](/somefiles/FImage for net48.zip),
- Unzip the zip file wherever you want,
- Double click on the `FImage.exe` file,
- and you're good to go.

## system requirements

For the moment, it works only on a ***Windows 10*** *64 bits*. In the near future, a **Linux**__ version will be released. And if all goes well, there might be a version for **Mac**__.

This software consumes relatively little memory. However, I think it is necessary to have at least 8 GB of RAM.

## installation

Download the [ZIP file](/somefiles/FImage for net48.zip), unzip it in the directory of your choice.

The installation is finished.

## launch the application

Once installed, select the `FImage.exe` file then double click it to launch it.

## use

Everything is in the menus. Eventually, there will be a detailed description of the thing with nice pictures.

### file operations

- <Ctrl+O>: opens a file,
- <Ctrl+S>: save a file,
- <Ctrl+Q>: close the application
  - ***WARNING***: if a file is modified, the application closes without warning, all modifications will be lost! A next version will allow to modify this behavior.
- <Ctrl+D>: reloads the current file, all modifications are lost.

### filters

The current filters are quite primitive and only work on the RGB channels of the image.

- <Ctrl+R>: performs a 90° clockwise rotation of the image (ok, it's not a filter, but it's useful),
- <Ctrl+T>: performs a rotation of the RGB channels to the right, that is, RGB becomes BRV,
- <Ctrl+L>: performs a rotation of RGB channels to the left, that is, RGB becomes BRV,
- <Ctrl+G>, <Ctrl+K> and <Ctrl+H>: produces a two *color* image only, pure black and pure white, with different thresholds for each shortcut; lithography effect, 1968 tract, ... and I like it a lot (detailed explanation later, but thanks for asking)
- <Ctrl+X>, <Ctrl+C>, <Ctrl+V>, <Ctrl+M>, <Ctrl+N>: highlights the most *bright* color with, for each shortcut, a different threshold. Fun, very fun and yes, there will be explanations later.
